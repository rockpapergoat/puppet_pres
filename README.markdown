this is a collection of presentation slides meant as an introduction to puppet and some os x specific stuff, like packaging, deploystudio, mcx management, and others.

it's a work in progress.

the older slideshow is incomplete. the newer one picks up where the old left off and covers some basic munki usage, as well.
